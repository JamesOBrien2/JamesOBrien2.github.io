abstract = {{In recent years, halogen bond‐based organocatalysis has garnered significant attention as an alternative to hydrogen‐based catalysis, capturing considerable interest within the scientific community. This transition has witnessed the evolution of catalytic scaffolds from monodentate to bidentate architectures, and from monovalent to hypervalent species. In this DFT‐based study, we explored a bidentate hypervalent iodine(III)‐based system that has already undergone experimental validation. Additionally, we explore various functionalisations (‐CF\$\_3\$, ‐CH\$\_3\$, ‐tBu, ‐OH, ‐OMe, ‐NO\$\_2\$, ‐CN) and scaffold modifications, such as sulfur oxidation, theoretically proposed for an indole‐based Michael addition. The investigated systems favour bidentate O‐type binding, underlining the importance of ligand coordination in catalytic activity. Electron‐deficient scaffolds exhibited stronger binding and lower activation energies, indicating the pivotal role of electronic properties for \$\textbackslashsigma\$‐hole‐based catalysis. Of these groups, Lewis‐base‐like moieties formed stabilising intramolecular interactions with hypervalent iodines when in the ortho‐position. Furthermore, inductive electron withdrawal was deemed more effective than mesomeric withdrawal in enhancing catalytic efficacy for these systems. Lastly, increasing sulfur oxidation was theoretically proven to improve catalytic activity significantly.}},

abstract = {{The chemistry of low-valent intermediates continues to inspire new modes of reactivity across synthetic chemistry. But while the generation and reactivity of both carbenes and nitrenes are well-established, difficulties in accessing oxene, their oxygen-based congener, has severely hampered its application in synthesis. Here, we report a conceptually novel approach to oxene generation through the violet-light photolysis of tetrabutylammonium periodate. By revealing an unexpected geometric change upon periodate photoexcitation that facilitates intersystem crossing, we have exploited the near-barrierless dissociation of triplet periodate into oxene. Under these operationally simple conditions, we have demonstrated the epoxidation of a wide range of substituted olefins, revealing unprecedented functional group compatibility. By overcoming the historic challenges associated with employing oxene as an intermediate in organic chemistry, we believe that this platform will inspire the development of new reactive oxygen-based methodologies across industry and academia.}},
