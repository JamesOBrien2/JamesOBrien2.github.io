<p>
This page displays projects I've undertaken (typically in collaboration) to elucidate reaction mechanisms using computational chemistry methods. I aim to include some figures and videos to illustrate key mechanistic steps and intermediates across many of the reactions I've studied. I find that these projects are some of the most enjoyable and rewarding projects I've undertaken, as they've allow me to reengage with fundamental organic chemistry concepts, which I always found fascinating. So to that I thank my collaborators for allowing me to be involved in these studies!
