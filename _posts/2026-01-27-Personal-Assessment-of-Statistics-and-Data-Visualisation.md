# A Brief and Personal Assessment of Statistics and Data Visualisation in Chemistry

Recently my girlfriend, Caroline, started a Statistics diploma alongside her PhD. Our conversations have made me realise how underused statistical thinking can be in everyday chemistry research, especially when we’re trying to compare methods, rank catalysts, or make decisions under uncertainty.

In my area (computational chemistry and catalyst design), statistics feels less like an “extra” and more like a missing layer: it helps separate signal from noise, quantify trade-offs, and turn scattered results into something you can optimise. As datasets grow (more calculations, more screening, more automated workflows) this becomes even more important.

Data visualisation is the other half of the problem. Even strong results can be easy to ignore if the figure is hard to read, poorly labelled, or visually noisy. Clear plots don’t just look nicer; they reduce misinterpretation and make it easier to explain a niche result to a broader scientific audience.

This blog series is my personal attempt to get better at both: practical statistics for scientific decision-making, and simple, readable visualisation habits I can use in my own work and hopefully share with others doing similar research.
